# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import the standard Libraries.

2.Set variables for assigning dataset variables. 

3.Import linear regression from sklearn. 

4.Assign the points for representing in the graph. 

5.Predict the regression for marks by using the representation of the graph.

6.Compare the graphs and hence we obtained the linear regression for the given datas.
